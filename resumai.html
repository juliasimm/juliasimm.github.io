                            When Googling "Non target school, job search", I'm faced with endless numbers of forums expressing 
                            feelings of discouragement, concern, and confusion regarding the job search. On Youtube, there is an abundance
                            of videos showcasing success stories of those from non target schools and their "secret" as to how they managed
                            to land their dream job. It was evident that there is a need for a solution in this problem space.

                                The initial version of our solution was a resume bullet point generator heavily inspired by the STAR method. 
                                Not only did I talk to job seekers, but hiring managers and recruiters. When asked "What makes a good resume?",
                                almost all responses included something that the STAR method consisted of, or directly referred to the STAR method
                                itself.<br><br>
                                The initial solution was simple. Users answer 5 questions, select past or present tense, and generate bullet points.
                                From there, they can edit, copy, or regenerate points.

                                3 out of 4 job seekers felt that the process to generate a bullet point is too time consuming and extensive.
                                One interviewee mentioned that they wouldn't use the tool because they don't need to create a bullet point completely 
                                from scratch. They expressed that they have a good idea of what they want their bullet point to look like, but they
                                would want to improve upon it.

                            After receiving that feedback during testing, my goal for the next iteration was to create a product that offers
                            different experiences for Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced resume writers. In V2, users can choose if they want
                            to create a resume bullet point from scratch using the 5 question STAR method, or they can simply have our AI rewrite and improve
                            an existing bullet point.

                            I explored a couple different ways to convey the switch between the "Create New Points" and "Improve Points".
                            Ultimately I chose the "Tab to Switch" design as it depicted the clearest change in state. My only concern was 
                            that the lack of component (ie: button, toggle switch) makes it unclear if the tab is clickable, however,
                            the change in colour when hovering over the text was able to solve this concern.

                            There are many other resume builders and templates in the market however, what made ResumeAI special is the
                            resume bullet point generation that will be embedded within the resume builder. Because of this unique feature,
                            it was crucial to find an optimal layout that makes the embedded AI generator seamlessly fit in the product.

                            Due to the disadvantages discovered in the first iteration, I created a new iteration using the "Word Document Style",
                            where users can simply click on the document and edit right then and there - similar to a Microsoft Word or Google Doc.
                            This reduced the added work required for users to input their changes and open/collapse sections.

                            With the second iteration, I began to ask myself, "What makes this better than a Word document?" Users could essentially copy
                            and paste the resume template onto a Word Document and potentially have an even better experience, where they can modify margins,
                            select from a slew of fonts, etc. And although this design enables more flexibility for the user, I realized that it offered
                            too much flexibility. ResumeAI needed to cater to those building resumes and offer functionalities that Microsoft Word couldn't.
                            <br><br>
                            My third iteration implemented small widgets that handle different types of data inputs. I had date pickers, location mapping,
                            dropdowns, among other components, in order to make resume builder experience easier than just typing it out on a document.

                            This project had a lot of versions and iterations. This meant a 
                            lot of back and forth with the engineers. I learned that frequent and constant communication 
                            and good design documentation really streamlines the handoff process.  <br> <br>

                            As someone who loves visual design and prototyping, it’s always so tempting to jump into Figma and get to designing.
                            It's important to squeeze out as much as you can during the ideation stage - you can potentially be missing out on a 
                            really cool idea, or think of it later and have to restart your design process.
