                            My task at hand was to redesign; to change. Change is good, but how much is too much? It’s
                            no surprise that a completely new interface can result in "shocking" the user into a
                            confused or even frustrated state. <br><br>
                            As you can see in my first iteration, I was hesitant to stray far from the original
                            design. Once I took a step back and looked at my first iteration, I still thought it was
                            outdated, visually unappealing, and barely addressed the initial flaws of the current
                            interface. <br> <br>
                            With that being said, I pivoted. User shock
                            was still a concern of mine, but in my eyes, an overhaul was deemed appropriate, and through
                            user testing I ensured that usability and learnability was always a priority.

                            It became clear to me that inconsistency did not lie solely in the Currency Calculator but
                            in all of OANDA’s products. It seemed as though depicting OANDA’s brand was a challenge in
                            of itself. Here are three completely different screens that are all tied to OANDA’s
                            products.

                        I faced a lot of challenges during this redesign, ones I’m sure that most designers have
                        experienced
                        as well — especially when serving the role as the sole designer of a project. <br> <br>
                        This project made me learn a lot about myself — who I am, how I work, and how I face
                        adversity. I’m a people person, and during this process, it was important for me to have others
                        that
                        I can bounce ideas off of; to both assure and challenge me. Although I loved the autonomy, it
                        was the moments where I asked questions, received feedback,
                        and presented my work to stakeholders that made me feel most creative and inspired.
