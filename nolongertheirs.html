                            thrifting echoed the majority of what my survey respondents had to share.
                            Lara was easy to begin designing for, as I felt as though I all already knew Lara or

                            it came to me as a surprise, it was important for me to consider Riley as a target persona.

                            I then decided on the features most needed on the platform to address the users' pain
                            points and to enhance their thrift store experiences. I also ideated upon potential features
                            that my users could benefit from and prioritized them based on the project scope.

                            Before I began sketching, I created a site map, customer journey map, and user flow to
                            visualize the user experience that I was constructing. I find that it’s easier for me to
                            sketch my ideas when I already know what information I’m provided, how it’s going to be
                            organized, and roughly what order they should be presented to my users. <br><br>

                        The flow allowed for searching for a product via categories, filtering down the listed
                        products, and adding to the shopping cart. After it was in the cart, the user would be
                        able to check out as a guest and after completing the order, create an account.
                        This user flow could easily be adapted to fit any product on the site, making it a great
                        starting point for the next phase of our design process.

                        Before considering how the brand might look, I wanted to determine how the brand
                        should feel. I created an inception board depicting the space, colour, shape, and movement of my
                        design determined by the target audience and their goals as users. <br> <br>
                        The key principles of <span>minimal</span>, <span>empowering</span>, and <span>modern</span>
                        guided my visual treatments to have a contrasting colour palette and minimalist, trendy
                        illustration accents, combined with a clean, classic typeface and layout.
