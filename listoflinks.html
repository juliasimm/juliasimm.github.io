                        I like making lists- my favourite being my list of cool links I find on the Internet.
                        I thought it would be nice to more formally synthesize my thoughts and document my favourite
                        articles, products, resources- the list goes
                        on.

                    I listen to Lofi religiously when designing, but that the music was the reason why I
                    added this link to the list. By interacting with elements in the room, you can build your own custom
                    music room and share your unique room with others. Great aesthetic and kept me amused for an
                    embarrassingly long amount of time.

                    This website dissects Ali Wong’s stand-up comedy special, Baby Cobra. I have a newfound respect for
                    stand up comedians- the thoughtfulness and strategy applied to
                    every line in an hour-long production is commendable to say the least. I've never seen data
                    visualiztion and animation done better.

                    2000s music has a special place in my heart. This website has a selection of around 50 hit
                    tracks from the 2007 and mashes them together for you. An honourable mention would be Touch The
                    Sky x Island In The Sun.

                        I love Tim Urban. In his inimitable style,
                        he tackles the most enigmatic, entangled topics, ranging from AI to politics, from
                        cryonics to picking a life partner. Simplifying the complex for the curious, Tim Urban
                        distills and presents complex ideas in a way that resonants with others. This is one of my
                        favourite articles of his. <br> <br>

                        What I love of about this article- and all of Urbans writing for that matter is his unique
                        style; his combination of wry stick-figure illustrations and epic prose. "I’m not going to cater
                        to anyone. I’m going to write a post that I wish someone would send me.”
