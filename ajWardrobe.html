                            My high school had an unspoken dress code: Lululemon leggings, a champion hoodie and Adidas
                            superstars. I, however, felt no desire to wear the same outfit as everyone else, let alone
                            wear the same outfit everyday. Not to mention, the brand name leggings, hoodie and shoes
                            racked up quite the price tag. <br> <br>
                            With that being said, my closet looked like the inside of a Forever 21, a slew of trendy
                            clothes, basic tees in every imaginable colour, and cheap jewelry that I would have to
                            repurchase every month or so. <br><br>
                            Somewhere along the road, I stumbled across a <a

                            By this time I realized that there was a disconnect between my wardrobe and what I stand
                            for. As a consumer, I can conscious choices and make deliberate purchases of what I need,
                            what I want, and what makes this earth a more sustainable place.

                        Soon enough, my closet evolved into a diverse collection of vintage brands, statement pieces
                        and expensive jewelry. I was always extremely content and never guilty for my purchases. So many
                        good things came out of thrifting and I began to wonder why more people weren't shopping
                        second-hand! But I came to the realization that

                        Not because it requires a specialized skill, but because thrifting is quite an
                        unpleasant experience. You’re essentially standing on your feet for hours, sifting through
                        used (and most of the time, not washed) clothing, just to find a few diamonds in the rough.
                        But I realized that I had a knack for thrifting; I’m patient, I have my own established
                        style, and I have a pretty solid “Price is Right” meter when gauging retail pricing. <br> <br>
                        Quickly, my small reach-in closet was not able to support my excessive
                        thrifting habits as I reached a point where I couldn’t open my closet without expecting an
                        avalanche of clothes to topple over me. I was ironically over-thrifting, thus, going against
                        all of my eco-fashion ideals.

                        at a higher price than what I found at the second-hand shop, but at a lower price than what
                        they would sell for at the mall.

                        audience can engage with me like surveys, polls, and Q and As in the comments section. The more
                        engagement your account generates, the more profit and customer trust you gain. Secondly, how
                        you <span>communicate with your following</span> is vital to your brand. Little things like
                        using emojis, greetings, and how you respond to comments determines how your audience perceives
                        you as a business. Not to mention, being polite yet firm when negotiating with clients in
                        private messages.

                        and on most weeks, I yielded a 55% profit margin. I used spreadsheets to create budget plans and
