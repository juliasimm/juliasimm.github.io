                    Working alongside the product manager, we devised a roadmap to iterate and deploy 3 versions of
                    LBT: Bronze (MVP), Silver, and Gold. Each deployment was scoped with their own feature sets
                    to ensure that LCOs are delivered their “must-haves” at the very least.

                    Not only did this approach fit within our time constraint, but it allowed for me to receive
                    continuous user feedback and quantitative data to validate assumptions and understand what needs to
                    be addressed for the upcoming version.

                            However, unlike Bronze, where a PDF of a single label is immediately downloaded upon
                            print confirmation, in Silver, when a product is selected, they are added to a Printing
                            List.

                            When the user proceeds to print, all items in
                            the list are printed so that multiple labels are printed on a single page. After a printing
                            session, the printing list is emptied, and will then be archived in “Print History”.

                            similar to an online shopping cart which can be easily grasped and adopted by our users.

                            solve this issue, LCOs need to be able to print labels with upcoming prices ahead of time.

                            They were expecting some form of feedback to notify them that the item has been added to

                            This project taught me how to juggle trade offs and adapt. Inevitably, not everything was
                            able to be included in the scope and it was up to me to know what to fight for, what to let
                            go of, and how to make those decisions. For instance, my original designs included an
                            onboarding experience and tooltips to guide users on the new platform. However, from a
                            development standpoint, there simply was not enough time. From there, I focused on making
                            tasks as straightforward as possible with thorough instructions, explicit labels, and I
                            opted for a PDF support guide instead.
